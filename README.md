SayÄ± Bul is a mobile game that I developed as a high school student in 2016.

It's a puzzle game. There is a 4 digit number and player try to find that number with some outputs.

For example the number that we try to find is 2704 and the estimate number that we enter is 2649
Then the output will be one "+" and one "-". 
  Meaning of this output is -> One digit from your estimate is correct and it's in correct place (+) -> 2
                            -> One digit from your estimate is correct but its place is wrong (-) -> 4
                            
  
  
Codes are little bit complicated because of the experience that I had that times :D
